Reflections: 
    After not coding for a while, I'm happy to find out I still retained a bit of knowledge.
    This is a redo of an old CMPT 213 assignment I did back in 2018. This time, I tried to 
    completely separate the Model, View, and Controller. There is no text output in main! 
    I also realized I was reusing a lot of the same code when scanning for user input so I
    extracted that code into it's own method which im proud of! i bet in 2018 i just resued 
    that code over and over again haha. 
    
    I'm starting to slowly fall in love with coding again :) 
    here's to many more projects in the future!
    
    NOTE: changed the name after realizing the professor still uses this assignment. 
    Wouldn't want anyone to steal code :)
